## The L298N Motor Driver Module
To control the speed and direction of the 2 DC motors, we will be using the L298N motor driver. The L298N contains 2 H-bridges which allows us to control the direction of 2 DC motors individually, while pulse-width modulation (PWM) will be used to control the speed of the motors.

### H-Bridge
We can control the direction of a DC motor by swapping the polarity of voltage applied to the motor. This is done through an electronic circuit called a H-bridge. A H-bridge consists of 4 switches which work together to control the polarity of voltage applied to the motor.
