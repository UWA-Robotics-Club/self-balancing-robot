## The MPU6050
In this project, we will be using the MPU6050 to measure the robot's orientation and movement in real time. The MPU6050 is a small, low-cost sensor module that contains both an accelerometer and a gyroscope. 

- edit below


The accelerometer in the MPU6050 measures acceleration in three dimensions (x, y, and z), and the gyroscope measures angular velocity around those same three dimensions. 

The combination of these sensors provides a complete measurement of the device's motion in all six degrees of freedom (3 axes of acceleration and 3 axes of rotation). 


The gyroscope measures angular velocity, or how fast the device is rotating around its three axes (x, y, and z). The accelerometer measures linear acceleration, or how fast the device is moving along those same three axes. By combining the data from both sensors, the MPU6050 is able to determine the device's orientation in space, including its tilt and movement in all three dimensions.

 The IMU typically includes accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure the robot's acceleration and rotation, respectively.


TO DO
- background on what mpu6050 is and how it works??

## Interfacing? the MPU6050
TO DO

### MPU6050 Pinout 
TO DO
- explanation of each pin and what it does??
- specifically those we are using


## Code???
TO DO

- clean up arduino code i have already written
- give credit to those who actually wrote it lmao

### Libraries??
- list libraries used
- tutorial on how to download them 
- and verify that they installed (attempt to compile)

### Calibrating the MPU6050
- code from website

### Reading the Angle of Inclination
- my code which i wrote (adapted from website)
- 


the end??
