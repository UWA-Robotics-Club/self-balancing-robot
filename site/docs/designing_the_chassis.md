## CAD Software
CAD (or Computer-Aided Design) software, such as Fusion 360 or SolidWorks, allows us to create 3D models which can then be manufactured. For the self-balancing robot, we will be using Fusion 360 to design the chassis.


### Fusion 360
1. To install Fusion 360 (Education License), click <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/education/fusion-360" target="_blank">here</a>. This will take you to the Fusion 360 educational site.
2. Click 'Get Fusion 360'.

> Tip: To check that the Fusion you have installed is the education version, run the application. It should say 'Autodesk Fusion 360 (Educational License)' in the top left corner.


## Design Considerations
- where to put all the parts
- how to access battery to change it?
- maybe include overall circuit here
- weight distribution?


## Laser Cutting and 3D Printing
